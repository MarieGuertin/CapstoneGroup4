# End-to-end SLU model for Timers and Such

Attention-based RNN sequence-to-sequence model for [Timers and Such](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01604) trained on the `train-real` subset. This model checkpoint achieves 86.7% accuracy on `test-real`.

The model uses an ASR model trained on LibriSpeech ([`speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech`](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech)) to extract features from the input audio, then maps these features to an intent and slot labels using a beam search. 

The dataset has four intents: `SetTimer`, `SetAlarm`, `SimpleMath`, and `UnitConversion`. Try testing the model by saying something like "set a timer for 5 minutes" or "what's 32 degrees Celsius in Fahrenheit?"

You can try the model on the `math.wav` file included here as follows:
```python
from speechbrain.pretrained import EndToEndSLU
slu = EndToEndSLU.from_hparams("speechbrain/slu-timers-and-such-direct-librispeech-asr")
slu.decode_file("speechbrain/slu-timers-and-such-direct-librispeech-asr/math.wav")
```
### Inference on GPU
To perform inference on the GPU, add  `run_opts={"device":"cuda"}`  when calling the `from_hparams` method.

### Training
The model was trained with SpeechBrain (d254489a).
To train it from scratch follows these steps:
1. Clone SpeechBrain:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/
```
2. Install it:
```
cd speechbrain
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

3. Run Training:
```
cd  recipes/timers-and-such/direct
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder=your_data_folder
```

### Limitations
The SpeechBrain team does not provide any warranty on the performance achieved by this model when used on other datasets.
